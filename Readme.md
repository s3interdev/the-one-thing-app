# The One Thing App

## Summary

I was brand new to React.JS, this was the project I cut my teeth on.

The UI was kept very simple so that I could focus on concepts like creating components, using and passing state, handling events, prop drilling, and more!

The project also put into practice proper management of Git by organizing code into staging and production ready branches so that there is always a version of the code ready to go.

Finally, the repetitive process of building and deploying the project to production was automated by using GitHub Actions for onward deployment to Firebase Hosting.
